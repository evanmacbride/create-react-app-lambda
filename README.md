# Read Wikipedia

A simple, text-only Wikipedia reader built with React and the Wikipedia API. This site was designed to be easy to read, with simple, elegant typography and a gentle color palette. 

To use, first enter your search in the query field (either on the main landing page or in the header of subsequent pages). Then click to load your desired Wikipedia article. A collapsible table of contents and a jump-to-top button make navigation within an article easy.
